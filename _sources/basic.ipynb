    "Here's the scenario: **I want to search for free-to-use color posters from the Library of Congress and display the results**.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to perform a JSON request, you will need to have a URL for that request. Luckily, it's quite straightforward to build it! In the case of the Artist Posters collection, the default URL is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://www.loc.gov/collections/artists-posters/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be converted to a JSON url by simply adding a parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://www.loc.gov/collections/artists-posters/?fo=json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add this parameter to any faceted search on loc.gov. For example, this searches within the Artist Posters collection for the keyword \"color\" and filters by date (between 1800 and 1925) and location (United States) to only include images that are in the public domain due to copyright expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://www.loc.gov/collections/artists-posters/?q=color&dates=1800/1925&fa=location:united+states&fo=json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the URL, we can get started with the code!\n",
