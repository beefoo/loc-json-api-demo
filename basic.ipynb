    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://www.loc.gov/collections/artists-posters/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be converted to a JSON url by simply adding a parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://www.loc.gov/collections/artists-posters/?fo=json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add this parameter to any faceted search on loc.gov. For example, this searches within the Artist Posters collection for the keyword \"color\" and filters by date (between 1800 and 1925) and location (United States) to only include images that are in the public domain due to copyright expiration.\n",
